		<p>Shiva (o radiante) é a terceira pessoa da Trindade hindú. Sendo Brama o Criador e Vishnu o Conservador, tinha que haver um deus Destruidor para completar todo o sistema, tendo esta função sido destinada a este deus. Porém, este destruidor não passa de um recriador, destroi mas faz com que os seres revitalizem a sua existência. <img src="Images/medium-god-s-lord-shiva-on-fine-art-paper-hd-quality-wallpaper-original-imaga2dh7ccugshb.webp" title="Eis a shiva" height="450" width="600"> Muitas vezes, este deus é representado como um Brama, por ter tais poderes. Como todos os outros elementos da trindade, também se casou. Era casado com Parvati (ou Bhavani), que por sinal era sua filha, irmã e mãe. Deste primeiro matrimónio nasceram Genesa e Skanda (Kartikeia). Uniu-se também a Durga, que encarnara em Kali (negra) e Gauri (a loira), uma a guerra outra a fecundidade.</p>

Perhaps that is why current discussions of the problem give it little attention or get it obviously wrong. The recent wave of reductionist euphoria has produced several analyses of mental phenomena and mental concepts designed to explain the possibility of some variety of materialism, psychophysical identification, or reduction.' But the problems dealt with are those common to this type of reduction and other types, and what makes the mind-body problem unique, and unlike the water-H20 problem or the Turing machine-IBM machine problem or the lightning-electrical discharge problem or the gene-DNA problem or the oak tree-hydrocarbon problem, is ignored.</p>
		<p><img src="Images/Untitled.jpeg" width="100" height="100" align="middle" />Every reductionist has his favorite analogy from modern science. It is most unlikely that any of these unrelated examples of successful reduction will shed light on the relation of mind to brain. But philosophers share the general human weakness for explanations of what is incomprehensible in terms suited for what is familiar and well understood, though entirely different. This has led to the acceptance of implausible accounts of the mental largely because they would permit familiar kinds of reduction. I shall try to explain why the usual examples do no help us to understand the relation between mind and body- why, indeed, we have at present no conception of what an expla- nation of the physical nature of a mental phenomenon would be. Without consciousness the mind-body problem would be much less interesting. With consciousness it seems hopeless. The most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very poorly understood. Most reductionist theories do not even try to explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently available concept of reduction is applicable to it. Perhaps a new theoretical form can be devised for the purpose, but such a solution, if it exists, lies in the distant intellectual future</p>
		<p><img src="Images/Untitled.jpeg" width="100" height="100" align="bottom" />Conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon. It occurs at many levels of animal life, though we cannot be sure of its presence in the simpler organisms, and it is very difficult to say in general what provides evidence of it. (Some extremists have been prepared to deny it even of mammals other than man.) No doubt it occurs in countless forms totally unimaginable to us, on other planets in other solar systems throughout the universe. But no matter how the form may vary, the fact that an organism has conscious experience at all means, basically, that there is something it is like to be that organism. There may be further implications about the form of the experience; there may even (though I doubt it) be implications about the behavior of the organism. But fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism-something it is like for the organism.</p>

		<p>Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG. A photograph that features snow or an overcast sky might look like it has large areas that are just white or gray, but the picture is usually made up of many different colors that are subtly different.</p>
		<p>When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as flat color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors. (Note that photographs of snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors, they are made up of many subtly different shades of the same color and are not as suited to GIF or PNG format.)</p>
