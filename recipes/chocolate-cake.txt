Tips:

	- use neutral tasting oil
	- do not reduce the sugar

Why it works:

	- sugar/flour ratio. More sugar than flour prevents gluten formation
	- Cocoa particles - cocoa powder has some starch and does contribute some function of flour to provide structure to the cake, however it does not contain gluten proteins. When the cocoa is dispersed into the flour, it helps to break up the flour particles and also interferes with gluten develop
